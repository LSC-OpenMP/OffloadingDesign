\section{The goal of the design}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The offload infrastructure should support multiple target device types at runtime and be extensible in the future with minimal or no changes.

  \item The infrastructure should determine the availability of target devices at runtime and make a decision to offload depending on the availability and load of a target device.
\end{itemize}
